Change your projects life... rewrite history!!!

Git blame, and more generally, the history of a project as viewed through git
 commits is critically useful.  Therefore, deciding to broadly reformat the
 project, say, to comply with PEP-8 has, the negative side effect of
 destroying much of the history exposed by blame.  Many projects,
 unfortunately, decide that the history is more valuable than clean readable
 code.

Ideally, we'd like to reformat yet maintain the Git annotations.

Introducing the GitHistoricalReDisEntangler, or some other really fancy name.
